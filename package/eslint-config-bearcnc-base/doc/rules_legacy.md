## Objects

- 3.1 Use the literal syntax for object creation. eslint: [`no-object-constructor`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-object-constructor)

  **Availability:** `es5`, `es6`

  **Note:** Originally it was eslint: [`no-new-object`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-new-object) but was deprecated as of V8.50.0 so it was replaced with this.

  Bad:

  [//]: # (expectedErrors: 2)

  ```js
  Object();
  
  new Object();
  ```
  
  Good:

  [//]: # (expectedErrors: 0)

  ```js
  Object("foo");
  
  var obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
  
  var isObject = function(value) {
    return value === Object(value);
  };

  var createObject = function(ObjectConstructor) {
    return new ObjectConstructor();
  };
  ```

- 3.6 Only quote properties that are invalid identifiers. eslint: [`@stylistic/quote-props`](https://eslint.style/rules/quote-props)

  > Why? In general we consider it subjectively easier to read. It improves syntax highlighting, and is also more easily optimized by many JS engines.

  **Availability:** `es5`, `es6`

  **Note:** Originally it was eslint: [`quote-props`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-new-object) but was deprecated as of V8.53.0 so it was replaced.

  Bad:

  [//]: # (expectedErrors: 4, eslint: 'no-var: "off"')

  ```js
  var object = {
      "a": 0,
      "0": 0,
      "true": 0,
      "null": 0
  };
  ```

  Good:

  [//]: # (expectedErrors: 0, eslint: 'no-var: "off"')

  ```js
  var object1 = {
      "a-b": 0,
      "0x0": 0,
      "1e2": 0
  };

  var object2 = {
      foo: 'bar',
      baz: 42,
      true: 0,
      0: 0,
      'qux-lorem': true
  };

  var object3 = {
      foo: function() {
          return;
      }
  };
  ```

  **keywords**

  Good:

  [//]: # (expectedErrors: 0, eslint: 'no-var: "off"')

  ```js
  var x = {
      while: 1,
      volatile: "foo"
  };
  ```

  **numbers**

  Good:

  [//]: # (expectedErrors: 0, eslint: 'no-var: "off"')

  ```js
  var x = {
    100: 1
  }
  ```
